My name is [Emily Harris](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio){:target="_blank"} and I am a freelance Speech Pathologist working in Melbourne, Australia. I work mainly with children.

I have a Masters in Speech and Language Pathology from Newcastle University, UK.

Over the last few years I have worked in a mixture of private, public and NGO settings, applying my speech pathology skills.

I particularly enjoy working with parents and building a rapport with them. This enables me to design tailored coaching strategies that work in the environments where children spend the most time (home and school).
